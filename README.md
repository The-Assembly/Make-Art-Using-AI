# Make-Art-Using-AI

Ever wish you could paint portraits like Da Vinci or Van Gogh? Well, artificial intelligence allows you to do the next best thing these days.

In this workshop, we’ll show you how to use CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to turn your photos into paintings in the style of your favorite classical artist. For this purpose, we’ll use TensorFlow in combination with Keras. TensorFlow is a free open-source software library developed by Google, especially useful for machine learning tasks.

Prerequisites:
• Knowledge of machine learning concepts 
• We’ll use Google Colab to write and execute our code: https://colab.research.google.com/
